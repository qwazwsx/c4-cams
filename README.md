### [~~LIVE VERSION CAN BE FOUND HERE~~](https://qwazwsx.herokuapp.com/c4-cams/)

Due to both issues with the hosting provider and this project being multiple years old at this point the live version is no longer active. If you want to set it up locally, instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/qwazwsx/c4-cams/issues/69#issuecomment-771360862)

Note: This project was my first ever real attempt at writing a full stack app in javascript. This code isn't pretty or efficient. In fact, It's all contained in one file. I'd love to archive this project away from public view, but, because of it's popularity (1,000,000+ unique page views over the years) I feel obligated to keep this repository public. Eventually, some day, I will get around to refactoring the codebase and getting a live version back up on the web.
